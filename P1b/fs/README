xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2007/v6.html, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (bootother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

Price, Yandong Mao, and Hitoshi Mitake.

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run "make".
On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you will
need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing x86 ELF
binaries.  See http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2007/tools.html.
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-".

To run xv6, you can use Bochs or QEMU, both PC simulators.
Bochs makes debugging easier, but QEMU is much faster. 
To run in Bochs, run "make bochs" and then type "c" at the bochs prompt.
To run in QEMU, run "make qemu".

# README FOR P1b

In subfolder 'user'
1) Added my own test case C program 'rekt.c'
2) Edited the 'makefile.mk' file to add make for 'rekt' and 'test0'
3) Edited 'usys.S' by adding the correct code for getopenedcount
4) Edited 'user.h' to provide the signature for the getopenedcount function

In subfolder 'include'
1) Defined the System call number of 'SYS_getopenedcount' as 22.

In subfolder 'kernel'
1) In 'syscall.c', in the array position 'SYS_getopenedcount' added the function pointer for getopenedcount to the appropriate handler
2) In 'sysfunc.h' added the function signature for 'sys_getopenedcount'
3) In 'sysproc.c', added the global variable 'getthecountofopen', setting the value to 0. Also defining the function 'sys_getopenedcount' to return 'getthecountofopen', i.e. the number of times open() system call has been called.
4) In 'sysfile.c' declared the variable of 'getthecountofopen' as extern; and increased the counter of the same by 1, in the open() function everytime it is called.
